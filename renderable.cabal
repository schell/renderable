-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            An API for managing renderable resources.

-- A longer description of the package.
description: The `renderable` package provides a method for managing resources
    of a rendering system. Resources are allocated according to a strategy and
    released automatically when your renderable data changes. These changes are
    detected during each draw call based on the hash of your renderable
    datatype.

    This package is meant to be pulled in as a portion of your rendering system.
    It aims to ease the task of managing allocation of resources over time as
    the value of your renderable datatype changes.
